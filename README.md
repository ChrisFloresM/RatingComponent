# Interactive Rating Component
This is an excercise project built over React and TailwindCSS.

It was created using ContextAPI to manage the state and avoid the "prop-drilling" issue. It 
might be an "overkill" but It works as a practice excercise of this React Feature.

This project is part of the FrontEnd Mentor Learning Path, so accessibility takes more relevance.
